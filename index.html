  <p>My name is Gregg DiChiara. When I began this project, I wasn't sure how to go about it. 
    When I tried to select an image from the LoremPixel site, it took forever for any of the images to load.
    It then occurred to me that maybe I could use one of my own stock images.  The image to the left
    is my cat Cinder.  Cinder and I were great "mousers". Cinder has a great nose and he can sniff out 
    a mouse from anywhere. But when it comes to actually getting rid of the mouse, well, he needs some help.
    That's where I come in. I get down and follow Cinder's cues. Then I try to outsmart the mouse by figuring
    out escape routes. Early on, I made the mistake of underestimating the mouse. I have since come to learn That
    mice are imbued with X-Men type powers. So you could think of this story as "Of X-Men and X-Mice".  </p>
